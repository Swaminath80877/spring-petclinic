**Created**: 2026-08-28

**Status**: Draft

**Input**: User description: "vets for spring-petclinic"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Vet List (Priority: P1)

As a clinic administrator, I want to see a list of all veterinarians so I can quickly understand who is available.

**Why this priority**: This is a core function for managing the clinic's staff and understanding available resources.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to the vets page and verifying that a list of vets is displayed.

### User Story 2 - View Vet Details (Priority: P2)

As a clinic administrator, I want to view the details of a specific veterinarian, including their specialties, so I can understand their expertise.

**Why this priority**: Provides detailed information about individual vets, which is important for scheduling and client inquiries.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting a vet from the list and verifying their details and specialties are shown.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a specific vet exists, **When** a user views the vet's profile, **Then** their first name, last name, and specialties are displayed.

### User Story 3 - Vet Serialization and Deserialization (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I want to ensure that Vet objects can be reliably serialized and deserialized, so that data can be stored and retrieved without corruption.

**Why this priority**: Ensures data integrity and is crucial for any persistence or data transfer mechanisms.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a Vet object, serializing it, deserializing it, and comparing the original and deserialized objects.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Vet object is created, **When** it is serialized and deserialized, **Then** the object's properties remain intact.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a vet's name or specialty name is blank?
- How does the system handle a vet with no specialties?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a paginated list of all registered veterinarians on the `/vets.html` endpoint.
- **FR-002**: System MUST show each vet's specialties on their profile.
- **FR-003**: System SHOULD cache vet list results to reduce database load.
- **FR-004**: System SHOULD allow switching languages using a URL parameter like `?lang=es`.
- **FR-005**: System SHOULD ensure that there are no hard-coded strings without internationalization in any HTML files.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Vet**: Represents a veterinarian. Key attributes include first name, last name, and a list of specialties.
- **Specialty**: Represents a veterinarian's area of expertise. Key attributes include the specialty name.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can view the list of all veterinarians within 2 seconds.
- **SC-002**: Vet details, including specialties, are displayed within 1 second of selection.
- **SC-003**: The system successfully caches vet list results, reducing database load by at least 30% during peak hours.
- **SC-004**: All user-facing strings are internationalized and can be translated.

## Assumptions

- Users have stable internet connectivity.
- The system will reuse existing base classes like `NamedEntity` and `Person`.
- Data persistence will be handled by Spring Data JPA.
- The project will use Maven for building.
- The project is compatible with recent stable versions of Spring Boot and Jakarta EE.
